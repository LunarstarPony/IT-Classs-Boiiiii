### Bandwidth and bps
    
    Bandwidth is measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another 
    within a network in a specific amount of time.
    
    Typically, bandwidth is expressed as a bitrate and measured in bits per second (bps).
    
    We Usually use MB/s btw

    Presentation: JPG, GIFS, ASCII
    Session: NetBIOS, PPTP, RPC, PAP
    Transport: TCP/UDP(Ports)
    Network: Routers,Layer 3 Switches(IP Address)
    Datalink: Switches(MAC Address)
    Physical: Hubs, NICS, Cables

### TCP/IP Layers 
    Application: HTTP
    Transport: TCP, UDP
    Network: IP, ARP, ICMP, IGMP
    Network Interface: Ethernet

Why layering OSI Model: The model uses layers to help give a visual description of what is going on with a particular networking system.
