### Bandwidth and bps
    
    Bandwidth is measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another 
    within a network in a specific amount of time.
    
    Typically, bandwidth is expressed as a bitrate and measured in bits per second (bps).

### NFC 

##### AKA Near-field Communication
    
    Near-Field-Communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols for communication 
    between two electronic devices over a distance of 4 cm or less.
    
    Used in most of the modern SmartPhone for Payment and Bluetooth Pairing.

### Cellular Network

##### AKA Mobile Network(4G LTE)

    A cellular network or mobile network is a communication network where the last link is wireless.
    The network is distributed over land areas called "cells".
    
    Commonly used on Phones, Cars and some IOT Devices.

### Technology Addiction

    Technology is everywhere, and it is not going away. Teenagers stare down at their iPhones, 
    or keep their eyes glued to a tablet or laptop, instead of observing the world around them.

### Crowdsourcing

    Crowdsourcing is the practice of engaging a ‘crowd’ or group for a common goal
    often innovation, problem solving, or efficiency.
    Powered by New Techonology, Social Media.

### Crowdfunding
    
    Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by 
    raising small amounts of money from a large number of people.
    
    Most of them are just Concept
    
    Having a lot of platform such as Indiegogo, Kickstarter.

### Difference between Crowdfunding and Crowdsourcing

    crowdsourcing is the sourcing of anything from a crowd
    
    crowdfunding is the sourcing of funds from a crowd. So crowdfunding is actually a specific type of crowdsourcing
    
### Metadata

### CMS


### DDoS Attack
    
##### AKA distributed denial-of-service attack
    
    the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources, Making real customer unable to connect.
    
    Might have over 1K sources makes it impossible to block.

### Botnet

    Bot net is a number or Internet-Connected Devices that's running one or few bots
    
    Bot net can be used for DDoS Attack, Steal Data, Send Spam and allow the attacker to access it's device and connection.
    
    It's usually Comuters that got infected by Virus

### RWD
 
##### AKA Responsive web design
    
    Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development 
    should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.
    
    Used in every website nowdays

### SEO

##### AKA Search engine optimization
    In simple terms, it means the process of improving your site to increase its visibility for relevant searches. 
    The better visibility your pages have in search results, 
    the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business.
    
    Used in most search Engine nowdays
    
### What's Communication Protocal?

    Communication Protocal is a set of rules computer used to communicate with others.
    The protocol defines the signals that the computers will give each other, 
    and other details such as how communication begins and/or ends.
    
### Why layering

    In networking, layering means to break up the sending of messages into separate components and activities.
    Each component handles a different part of the communication. 
    This can be referred to as the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model.
    
### OSI Model and TCP/IP Correspondece

![alt text](https://www.guru99.com/images/1/092119_0729_LayersofOSI3.png)

### OSI Model Layers

    Physical layer is responsible for sending bits from one computer to another.
    Datalink layer provides function for Encapsulation, Frame synchronization, Logical link control (Error & Flow control), Media access control (MAC, LAN switching, Physical addressing, QaS, VLAN, ...)
	Network layer provides function for Connection model, Host addressing and Message forwarding. 
	Transport layer provides the application-oriented layers 5 to 7 standardized access so that they do not need to consider the characteristics of the communications network.
    Session layer provides functions for Authentication, Authorization and Session restoration.
    Presentation layer provides functions for De/Encryption, data Coversion and compression.
    Application layer provides functions for applications and also connection to lower layer.

    
### OSI Model Layers

    Application: DHCP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP,... 
    Presentation: SSH, IMAP, FTP, TLS, SSL and AFP
    Session: H.265, iSNS, NetBIOS, PAP, RPC, SDP,...
    Transport: NetBIOS, iSCSI, SCTP, NBP, TCP, UDP,...
    Network: IPX, NAT, SCCP, HSRP, IP, RIP, IPSEC
    Datalink: ARP, ATM, DCAP, Ethernet, IEEE802.11 WiFi,...
    Physical: USB, DSL, ISDN, IEEE 1394, TransferJet,...

### HTTP vs HTTPS (Layer 7 Application Layer)

##### HTTP AKA Hypertext Transfer Protocal
	Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.
    HTTPS is and extension of HTTP for Secure Comminucation.
	In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). 
	
### TELNET vs SSH (Layer 7 Application Layer)

    Both Telnet and SSH are typically used to log into a machine and execute commands, however
	Telnet is Design specifically for local area network and SSH is design for Remote Access over Internet.
	Telnet and SSH both are Layer 7 application layer protocal.
	
### DNS (Layer 7 Application Layer)
   
##### DNS AKA Domain Name System
	DNS is like a Phonebook of the Internet，users access information online through Domian names like google.com or lunarstarpony.xyz.
	Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 
	DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
	
### IP (Layer 3 Network Layer)

##### IP AKA Internet Protocal
	An internet protocol (IP) address allows computers to send and receive information.
	There are four types of IP addresses: public, private, static, and dynamic.
	An IP address allows information to be sent and received by the correct parties, 
	which means they can also be used to track down a user's physical location.
	
### ICMP (Layer 3 Network Layer) Test

##### ICMP AKA Internet Control Message Protocol
	ICMP is a supporting protocol in the Internet protocol suite. 
	It is used by network devices, including routers, 
	to send error messages and operational information indicating success or failure when communicating with another IP address.
