### Bandwidth and bps
    
    Bandwidth is measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another 
    within a network in a specific amount of time.
    
    Typically, bandwidth is expressed as a bitrate and measured in bits per second (bps).

### NFC 
    AKA Near-field Communication
    
    Near-Field-Communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols for communication 
    between two electronic devices over a distance of 4 cm or less.
    
    Used in most of the modern SmartPhone for Payment and Bluetooth Pairing.

### Technology Addiction

    Technology is everywhere, and it is not going away. Teenagers stare down at their iPhones, 
    or keep their eyes glued to a tablet or laptop, instead of observing the world around them.

### DDoS Attack
    
    AKA distributed denial-of-service attack
    
    the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources, Making real customer unable to connect.
    
    Might have over 1K sources makes it impossible to block.

### What's Communication Protocal?

    Communication Protocal is a set of rules computer used to communicate with others.
    The protocol defines the signals that the computers will give each other, 
    and other details such as how communication begins and/or ends.
    
### Why layering

    In networking, layering means to break up the sending of messages into separate components and activities.
    Each component handles a different part of the communication. 
    This can be referred to as the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model.
    
### OSI Model and TCP/IP Correspondece

### OSI Model Layers

    Physocal layer is responsible for sending bits from one computer to another.
    Datalink layer is responsible for transfers data between nodes on a network segment across the physical layer.
	Network layer responsible for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. 
	Transport layer provides services to application layer and takes services from network layer.
    Session layer is responsible for establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, authentication and also ensures security.
    Presentation layer extracted The data from the application layer and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network.


    
### OSI Model Layers

    Application: HTTP, FTP
    Presentation: JPG, GIFS, ASCII
    Session: NetBIOS, PPTP, RPC, PAP
    Transport: TCP/UDP(Ports)
    Network: Routers,Layer 3 Switches(IP Address)
    Datalink: Switches(MAC Address)
    Physical: Hubs, NICS, Cables

### TCP/IP Layers

    Application: HTTP
    Transport: TCP, UDP
    Network: IP, ARP, ICMP, IGMP
    Network Interface: Ethernet

Why layering OSI Model: The model uses layers to help give a visual description of what is going on with a particular networking system.
